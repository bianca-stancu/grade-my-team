#### Team members: Bianca Stancu, Jelena Budakovic, Davide Matteri

## Description
Online grading system for universities. Each member grades their individual performance, as well as the team members.
After all members have completed the grading, the professor is allowed to grade the overall assignment, as well as individual participations, based on a suggested malus for fairness based on student's evaluations.
